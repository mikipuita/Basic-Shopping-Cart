# Basic-Shopping-Cart
This project involves developing an event-driven enterprise simulation GUI in Java for shopping cart functionality including item management, checkout, and invoicing. Utilized Swing for GUI components and file I/O for data handle. 

## Notes:

This was the first project completed during my Enterprise Computing class. The code is functional but I would definitely not complete it all under the same class/file if done again.
